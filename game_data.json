In this interactive experience, you're tasked with \"breaking\" the system of an old computer by exploring its files, using commands, and uncovering hidden secrets. With a variety of commands at your disposal, you can cause crashes, and even \"download\" mysterious files that could lead to system failures. Will you find all the ways to bring the system to its knees, or will you leave it intact?\n\n\nNote from the Developer:\n\nThis game was created in less than 2 days as part of my first game jam, and I did everything solo. Expect some bugs, as I had to work within a very tight timeframe. I had a lot of ideas for additional endings, but due to time constraints, I couldn't implement them all. Despite that, I really enjoyed the process and hope you have fun exploring the different ways to break the system!",
