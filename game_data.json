Like the world around you doesn‚Äôt quite fit anymore. Time seems to stretch, twist, or maybe even stop. Are you stuck in some kind of endless loop, or is there something deeper going on? It‚Äôs up to you to figure it out. Do you stay in the comfort of what you know, or do you dig for the truth? The choice is yours, and it‚Äôs not going to be easy.",
