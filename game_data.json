With a variety of commands at your disposal, you can cause crashes, and even \"download\" mysterious files that could lead to system failures. Will you find all the ways to bring the system to its knees, or will you leave it intact?\n\n\nNote from the Developer:\n\nThis game was created in less than 2 days as part of my first game jam, and I did everything solo. Expect some bugs, as I had to work within a very tight timeframe. I had a lot of ideas for additional endings, but due to time constraints, I couldn't implement them all. Despite that, I really enjoyed the process and hope you have fun exploring the different ways to break the system!",

In a last-ditch effort, you use an experimental backpack that lets you travel back in time, but only for a short period. Your mission is to go back in time and prevent the events that lead to the apocalypse. To do this, you must journey into the past. The backpack's power is limited, so you'll need to recharge it by finding energy sources scattered throughout the past. If you run out of power, time will start reversing, sending you back to the present and erasing all your progress. Every mistake brings the apocalypse closer. Can you beat the clock, change the past, and save the world? Or will time become your enemy?\n\n(and yes, we made an original soundtrack for game jam lol)\n\nMade for Inspire 2024",
